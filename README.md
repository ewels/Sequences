# Sequences

Sequences is a lightweight and quick DNA sequence manipulation tool.

A very common task for anyone involved in genetics is the manipulation of DNA
or RNA sequences. I need to find the reverse compliment of sequences all the
time, and I've been getting increasingly frustrated with the lack of a simple,
robust tool to do that - most require strictly formatted sequences, use Java
applets which take ages to load, and are generally faffy.

It does a couple of cool things, such as remembering your settings using HTML5
local storage, and giving the option to automatically copy results to the
clipboard in internet explorer.

It's free for anyone to use, and everything is included in the one HTML file.

See the [gh-pages](https://github.com/ewels/sequences/tree/gh-pages) branch
for the code.
